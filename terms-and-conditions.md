# Terms and Conditions

By utilizing our services, all clients hereby acknowledge and agree to adhere strictly to the terms and conditions set forth herein. Any violation of these policies may lead to consequences as detailed in this document, including, but not limited to, termination of services, imposition of additional fees, and forfeiture of booking privileges.

## No Shows

Clients are obliged to arrive punctually for their scheduled tutoring appointments. A grace period of 15 minutes will be permitted from the scheduled start time. Should a client fail to arrive within this 15-minute interval, they will be classified as a "no-show." While tutors may opt to continue the session if the client arrives more than 15 minutes late, they are not obligated to do so.

In the occurrence of a no-show, the client will not qualify for rescheduling or reimbursement. Conversely, if a tutor arrives late, the client is encouraged to contact us to explore alternative arrangements, including rescheduling or extending the meeting duration.

## Cancellation/Rescheduling

Clients must cancel or reschedule their appointments at least 4 hours before the scheduled start time. Notice within this timeframe is necessary to maintain eligibility for rescheduling or a refund. In emergencies or other extenuating circumstances, clients may contact us at (650) 209-0336 or via email at info@pumatics.com to request a cancellation or rescheduling. While we will endeavor to accommodate such requests, no guarantees of availability can be extended. Clients will not face penalties for unsuccessful cancellation attempts resulting from internal communication errors.

## Refund Policy

### Session Cancellation Fees
Clients are responsible for remitting a cancellation fee for sessions canceled with less than 4 hours notice. The fee is based on the session's scheduled duration:

- For sessions of 1 hour or longer, the cancellation fee will be equivalent to 1 hour at the standard or package rate, depending on the client's purchase and subject area.
- For sessions of 30 minutes, the cancellation fee will be equivalent to the 30-minute rate, based on the standard or package rate, depending on the client's purchase and subject area.
- In cases of no-show, clients will be charged 100% of the session cost, regardless of duration.

### Package Refunds
Clients may request a refund for unused tutoring package hours, provided the package remains valid and has not expired. Refund calculations will involve deducting the cost of utilized hours at the standard rate from the total package cost.

For instance, if a client acquires an AP & Honors Online Student Package (10 Hours) for $720 and subsequently requests a refund after utilizing three hours, the calculation would proceed as follows: the cost of three sessions (3 x $80 = $240) would be subtracted from the total, yielding a refund of $720 - $240 = $480.

**Note:** Any non-recoverable payment processing fees charged by third-party payment providers are not refundable and will be deducted from the refund amount.

## Student Packages

Package hours are valid for 365 days from the date the package code is sent to your email. For detailed refund information, please refer to the Refund Policy section above.

## Session Management

### Ending A Meeting Early
Should a client elect to conclude a scheduled meeting before the established end time, they will still be liable for the full payment corresponding to the initially planned duration of the session. If a tutor terminates the session early, they will arrange to reschedule the remaining time with the client at a mutually convenient time.

### Extending A Meeting Beyond The Booked Time Slot
If a client desires to extend a meeting beyond the initially booked timeframe, the additional time must be purchased before executing the meeting extension.

## Modifications to Terms and Conditions

We reserve the right to update or modify these terms and conditions at any time without prior notice. Any changes will be effective immediately upon being posted to our website or communicated to clients. Continued use of our services after any modifications constitutes acceptance of the updated terms. Clients are encouraged to review the terms and conditions periodically to stay informed of any updates.
